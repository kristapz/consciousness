2025-08-23 15:55:21,803 - INFO - Theory synthesis: Conscious access arises when a prefrontal ‘discriminator’ monitors the reliability of sensory signals and outputs a higher-order pointer to trustworthy first-order representations, thereby creating a stubborn disposition to believe. Phenomenal character can be paired with this access account via quality space theory, which ties how experiences feel to the system’s discriminability structure.
