      "Conscious access arises when large-scale, low-dimensional electromagnetic (EM) field configurations transiently organize timing across distributed neural populations over integration windows of roughly 200–500 ms, thereby constraining and aligning high-dimensional spiking dynamics.",
      "These field configurations are frequency- and state-specific: structured theta/alpha/beta/gamma patterns (e.g., traveling waves, standing connectome harmonics) support access, whereas slow-delta dominance disrupts higher-frequency organization and impairs access.",
      "EM fields provide a stable control scaffold (more stable than spiking) that enables routing, binding, and transfer of content across cortical and subcortical hubs; synchronization can coordinate timing beyond the limits of direct synaptic connectivity.",
      "Subcortical hubs (thalamus, pulvinar, superior colliculus, hypothalamus/PAG, mesopontine nuclei) gate global state, orienting priority, and an egocentric pivot that shapes the geometry of conscious perspective.",
      "Interoceptive rhythms, especially heartbeat, periodically entrain cortex into theta-synchronized networks with modular organization, modulating affective tone and providing phase references that can gate integration.",
      "Conscious access is closed by late, feedback-mediated recruitment and metacognitive reality monitoring in prefrontal circuitry, which also gates what is written into contextually organized long-term memory.",
      "Neuromodulators (e.g., cholinergic, noradrenergic, serotonergic) tune excitation–inhibition balance and preferred frequency bands, thereby sculpting which field modes are selectable and stabilizable; gamma indexes activation/infrastructure rather than content per se.",
      "EM field topology forms bounded integration domains that help solve binding and segregation (boundary problems), enabling content-specific pockets that are temporally chained to yield continuity of experience.",
      "Energetic and structural constraints (metabolic limits, structural connectome) shape the feasible EM field configurations and their stability, leading to selection of connectome-specific harmonic modes in conscious states."

    "mechanisms": {
      "ion_channels": "Voltage-gated and mechanosensitive channels (e.g., TRP, Piezo) and HCN contribute to frequency-specific resonance and susceptibility to field-level entrainment. Anesthetic agents (e.g., propofol via GABAergic potentiation) and targeted stimulation (tFUS, TI) modulate channel dynamics and thereby reorganize large-scale field patterns without necessarily increasing mean firing or BOLD power.",
      "cytoskeleton": "Cytoelectric coupling links extracellular fields to cytoskeletal organization via ephaptic, electrodiffusive, and mechanotransductive pathways, tuning synaptic timing machinery and network excitability. Mechanical–electrical interactions (tensegrity) provide a route for lasting aftereffects of patterned field dynamics.",
      "em_fields": "Mesoscopic EM fields implement low-dimensional control variables (traveling waves, standing connectome harmonics, bounded field pockets) that align spike timing, route working-memory content, and stabilize representations across drift. Under anesthesia, slow-delta waves crowd out structured alpha/beta/gamma organization; thalamic or closed-loop stimulation can restore the requisite field coordination.",
      "microtubules": "Speculative role as mechanosensitive and field-interactive elements potentially influenced by ultrasound; current evidence for a constitutive role in conscious access is limited.",
      "signaling_pathways": "Diffuse neuromodulatory systems set global gain and band preferences; interoceptive baroreceptor signaling triggers theta-synchronized cortical networks influencing mood and integration windows; astrocytic TRPA1 and glia-mediated K+ dynamics contribute to excitability ramping and intratrain facilitation during stimulation; corticocortical countercurrent interactions and hippocampal loops support contextual capture.",
      "perturbation_effects": "Thalamic stimulation can rapidly reverse anesthetic unconsciousness by reinstating band-specific coherence and traveling-wave organization. tFUS and TI can steer frequency-specific field patterns in deep and cortical hubs to causally modulate mood, memory, and connectivity with lasting aftereffects. Neurofeedback and meditation train large-scale oscillatory configurations; direct cortical stimulation reveals local excitation buildup preceding conscious reports."
    },
    "integration_framework": "State-setting subcortical hubs (thalamus, SC, brainstem) establish arousal, orienting priority, and an egocentric pivot. Interoceptive rhythms (notably heartbeat) inject periodic theta-phase references that modulate cortical excitability and synchronize distributed modules. On this scaffold, cortex selects and stabilizes connectome-constrained field modes (traveling waves and harmonics) that form bounded pockets aligning spike timing and routing content (e.g., via beta–gamma gating). Prefrontal reality monitoring closes the integration window, broadcasting and writing stabilized content into long-term memory via countercurrent cortical–hippocampal loops. Neuromodulators tune the accessibility and stability of these modes; perturbations (stimulation, anesthesia) shift field-mode selection and thus conscious access.",
    "key_predictions": [
      "Trial-by-trial strength and phase of heartbeat-locked theta synchronization (HIN) will predict visual awareness and confidence; baroreflex phase manipulation (e.g., Valsalva or carotid stimulation) will causally shift access thresholds.",
      "Closed-loop R-peak–locked tFUS or TI at theta targeting insula/ACC will modulate mood and the duration of integration windows, altering report rates without large changes in BOLD power.",
      "Restoring beta traveling-wave organization during propofol anesthesia (via thalamic stimulation or TI) will recover behavioral responsiveness and higher-frequency coherence despite persistent slow-delta power.",
      "Gauge-invariant field features (e.g., LFP differences or electric-field reconstructions) will decode conscious content across representational drift better than spiking patterns within and across sessions.",
      "Superior colliculus perturbation will degrade global field coordination (reduced coherence of pulvinar-centered pockets) and impair rapid orienting-related aspects of conscious access.",
      "Meditation training will increase stability and modular organization of connectome harmonics and strengthen frontal participation in occipital alpha entrainment; these changes will correlate with improved metacognitive accuracy.",
      "In figure–ground tasks, late PFC closure will coincide with the emergence of bounded field pockets; early unconscious semantic priming will occur without stable pocket formation.",
      "Interhemispheric working-memory transfer will be accompanied by transient theta and high-beta synchrony (but not gamma), and closed-loop beta bursts will bias routing direction.",
      "Theta TI to hippocampus will improve memory and increase field-pocket stability while reducing or leaving unchanged local BOLD, replicating and extending current findings.",
      "Schizophrenia will show reduced frontal participation and module-1 centrality in the HIN; these metrics will correlate with negative affect and cognitive symptoms.",
      "Closed-loop anti-phase slow-delta stimulation will reduce delta dominance and restore higher-frequency traveling-wave organization, improving conscious processing under sedation.",
      "Connectome-harmonic decomposition will reveal rapid, state-dependent mode selection that predicts transitions into and out of conscious states better than power spectra alone.",
      "Topological metrics of field pockets will predict binding/segregation and privacy of content and remain invariant across reference frames; stronger pocket boundaries will predict reduced cross-talk between unrelated contents."

Subcortical hubs set state, orienting, and perspective while interoceptive rhythms (notably heartbeat) impose theta-phase structure that modulates affect and integration; prefrontal reality monitoring then closes the window and writes stabilized content into memory.
