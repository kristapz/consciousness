      "Conscious access arises when large-scale, low-dimensional electromagnetic (EM) field configurations transiently organize timing across distributed neural populations over integration windows of roughly 200–500 ms, thereby constraining and aligning high-dimensional spiking dynamics.",
      "These field configurations are frequency- and state-specific: structured theta/alpha/beta/gamma patterns (e.g., traveling waves, standing connectome harmonics) support access, whereas slow-delta dominance disrupts higher-frequency organization and impairs access.",
      "EM fields provide a stable control scaffold (more stable than spiking) that enables routing, binding, and transfer of content across cortical and subcortical hubs; synchronization can coordinate timing beyond the limits of direct synaptic connectivity.",
      "Subcortical hubs (thalamus, pulvinar, superior colliculus, hypothalamus/PAG, mesopontine nuclei) gate global state, orienting priority, and an egocentric pivot that shapes the geometry of conscious perspective; critically, the superior colliculus (SC) can encode abstract, task-relevant variables in subspaces orthogonal to motor plans, providing early, context-dependent biasing signals for conscious access.",
      "Interoceptive rhythms, especially heartbeat, periodically entrain cortex into theta-synchronized networks with modular organization, modulating affective tone and providing phase references that can gate integration.",
      "Conscious access is closed by late, feedback-mediated recruitment and metacognitive reality monitoring in prefrontal circuitry, which also gates what is written into contextually organized long-term memory.",
      "Neuromodulators (e.g., cholinergic, noradrenergic, serotonergic) tune excitation–inhibition balance and preferred frequency bands, thereby sculpting which field modes are selectable and stabilizable; gamma indexes activation/infrastructure rather than content per se.",
      "EM field topology forms bounded integration domains that help solve binding and segregation (boundary problems), enabling content-specific pockets that are temporally chained to yield continuity of experience.",
      "Energetic and structural constraints (metabolic limits, structural connectome, conduction delays) shape the feasible EM field configurations and their stability, leading to selection of connectome-specific harmonic modes and traveling-wave routes in conscious states.",
      "Task context dynamically gates subcortical and cortical coding: active goals amplify SC and cortical category-related signals and their coupling, whereas passive viewing suppresses them, indicating that conscious access depends on context-sensitive recruitment of these loops."
    ],
    "mechanisms": {
      "ion_channels": "Voltage-gated and mechanosensitive channels (e.g., TRP, Piezo, HCN) confer frequency-specific resonance and susceptibility to field-level entrainment. Anesthetics (e.g., propofol via GABAergic potentiation) and targeted stimulation (tFUS, TI) modulate channel dynamics and reorganize large-scale field patterns without necessarily increasing mean firing or BOLD power.",
      "cytoskeleton": "Cytoelectric coupling links extracellular fields to cytoskeletal organization via ephaptic, electrodiffusive, and mechanotransductive pathways, tuning synaptic timing machinery and network excitability. Mechanical–electrical interactions (tensegrity) offer a pathway for state- and training-dependent aftereffects of patterned field dynamics.",
      "em_fields": "Mesoscopic EM fields implement low-dimensional control variables (traveling waves, standing connectome harmonics, bounded field pockets) that align spike timing, route working-memory content, and stabilize representations across drift. Subcortical field dynamics (in SC and pulvinar) can carry abstract category codes orthogonal to motor outputs, biasing cortical mode selection. Under anesthesia, slow-delta waves crowd out structured alpha/beta/gamma organization; thalamic or closed-loop stimulation can restore the requisite field coordination.",
      "microtubules": "Speculative mechanosensitive and field-interactive elements potentially influenced by ultrasound; current evidence for a constitutive role in conscious access remains limited.",
      "signaling_pathways": "Diffuse neuromodulatory systems set global gain and band preferences; interoceptive baroreceptor signaling triggers theta-synchronized cortical networks influencing mood and integration windows. Tecto-pulvinar-thalamo-cortical and tecto-basal ganglia loops convey SC-derived priority and abstract category signals that are context dependent and largely orthogonal to motor commands, shaping pulvinar gating and cortical recruitment; astrocytic TRPA1 and glia-mediated K+ dynamics contribute to excitability ramping and intratrain facilitation during stimulation.",
      "perturbation_effects": "Thalamic stimulation can rapidly reverse anesthetic unconsciousness by reinstating band-specific coherence and traveling-wave organization. tFUS and TI steer frequency-specific field patterns in deep and cortical hubs to causally modulate mood, memory, and connectivity with lasting aftereffects. Direct cortical stimulation reveals local excitation buildup preceding conscious reports. SC perturbations (inactivation/microstimulation) are predicted to selectively alter early category-related field dynamics and subsequent conscious categorization without necessarily changing eye movements."
    },
    "integration_framework": "State-setting subcortical hubs (thalamus, SC, brainstem) establish arousal, orienting priority, and an egocentric pivot. SC computes abstract, task-relevant variables in population subspaces orthogonal to motor output and communicates them via tecto-pulvinar and tecto-thalamic loops to bias pulvinar gating and cortical field-mode selection. Interoceptive rhythms (notably heartbeat) inject periodic theta-phase references that modulate cortical excitability and synchronize distributed modules. On this scaffold, cortex selects and stabilizes connectome-constrained field modes (traveling waves and harmonics) that form bounded pockets aligning spike timing and routing content (e.g., via beta–gamma gating). Prefrontal reality monitoring closes the integration window, broadcasting and writing stabilized content into long-term memory via countercurrent cortical–hippocampal loops. Neuromodulators tune the accessibility and stability of these modes; perturbations (stimulation, anesthesia) shift field-mode selection and thus conscious access.",
    "key_predictions": [
      "SC local field/EF patterns will encode abstract categories earlier than posterior parietal cortex and in subspaces orthogonal to saccade-related activity; the strength of SC–pulvinar theta/beta coherence will predict trial-by-trial awareness and confidence in categorization tasks.",
      "Causal SC inactivation will reduce category-report accuracy and confidence and destabilize pulvinar-centered field pockets, even when eye movements are controlled; microstimulation of category-selective SC subspaces will bias conscious categorization without inducing saccades.",
      "Simultaneous SC–pulvinar–PFC recordings will show directed theta/high-beta information flow from SC to pulvinar to PFC during active categorization that collapses during passive viewing.",
      "Trial-by-trial strength and phase of heartbeat-locked theta synchronization will predict visual awareness and confidence; baroreflex phase manipulation will causally shift access thresholds.",

      "Gauge-invariant field features (e.g., LFP differences or electric-field reconstructions) will decode conscious content across representational drift better than spiking patterns within and across sessions.",
      "In figure–ground tasks, late PFC closure will coincide with the emergence of bounded field pockets; early unconscious semantic priming will occur without stable pocket formation.",
      "Interhemispheric working-memory transfer will be accompanied by transient theta and high-beta synchrony (but not gamma), and closed-loop beta bursts will bias routing direction.",
      "Theta TI to hippocampus will improve memory and increase field-pocket stability while reducing or leaving unchanged local BOLD.",
      "Schizophrenia will show reduced frontal participation and module-1 centrality in the heartbeat-induced network; these metrics will correlate with negative affect and cognitive symptoms.",
      "Closed-loop anti-phase slow-delta stimulation will reduce delta dominance and restore higher-frequency traveling-wave organization, improving conscious processing under sedation.",
