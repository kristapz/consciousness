      "Conscious access arises when large-scale, low-dimensional electromagnetic (EM) field configurations transiently organize timing across distributed neural populations over integration windows of roughly 200–500 ms, thereby constraining and aligning high-dimensional spiking dynamics.",
      "These field configurations are frequency- and state-specific: structured theta/alpha/beta/gamma patterns (e.g., traveling waves, standing connectome harmonics) support access, whereas slow-delta dominance disrupts higher-frequency organization and impairs access.",
      "EM fields provide a stable control scaffold (more stable than spiking) that enables routing, binding, and transfer of content across cortical and subcortical hubs; synchronization can coordinate timing beyond the limits of direct synaptic connectivity.",
      "Subcortical hubs (thalamus, pulvinar, superior colliculus, hypothalamus/PAG, mesopontine nuclei) gate global state, orienting priority, and an egocentric pivot that shapes the geometry of conscious perspective; superior colliculus can encode abstract, task-relevant variables orthogonal to motor plans, providing early, context-dependent biasing signals for conscious access.",
      "Interoceptive rhythms, especially heartbeat, periodically entrain cortex into theta-synchronized networks with modular organization, modulating affective tone and providing phase references that can gate integration.",
      "Conscious access is closed by late, feedback-mediated recruitment and metacognitive reality monitoring in prefrontal circuitry, which also gates what is written into contextually organized long-term memory.",
      "Neuromodulators (cholinergic, noradrenergic, serotonergic) tune excitation–inhibition balance and preferred frequency bands, thereby sculpting which field modes are selectable and stabilizable; gamma indexes activation/infrastructure rather than content per se.",
      "EM field topology forms bounded integration domains that help solve binding and segregation (boundary problems), enabling content-specific pockets that are temporally chained to yield continuity of experience.",
      "Energetic and structural constraints (metabolic limits, structural connectome, conduction delays) shape the feasible EM field configurations and their stability, leading to selection of connectome-specific harmonic modes and traveling-wave routes in conscious states.",
      "Cytoskeletal state—particularly TAU isoform composition and post-translational modifications (PTMs) that govern microtubule stability, axon initial segment (AIS) organization, actin–microtubule cross-talk, presynaptic vesicle cycling, and mitochondrial coupling—sets precision, endurance, and frequency range of oscillatory field modes by gating spike-time reliability and sustained synchrony."
    ],
    "mechanisms": {
      "ion_channels": "Voltage-gated and mechanosensitive channels (e.g., Nav at AIS, TRP, Piezo, HCN) confer frequency-specific resonance and susceptibility to field-level entrainment. TAU-dependent AIS compartmentalization influences Nav clustering and spike initiation timing; TAU–Fyn–NMDA interactions shift excitatory gain and E/I balance. Anesthetics (e.g., propofol) and targeted stimulation (tFUS, temporal interference) modulate channel dynamics and reorganize large-scale field patterns without necessarily increasing mean firing or BOLD power.",
      "cytoskeleton": "Cytoelectric coupling remains the bridge from fields to structure, while new evidence strengthens a cytoskeleton-centered control layer: TAU isoforms stabilize or destabilize microtubules; dendritic TTLL6–spastin polyglutamylation severs MTs and impairs spines; TAU participates in AIS diffusion barriers; TAU interacts with PSD scaffolds (PSD95, Fyn) and presynaptic machinery (Dynamin1, SNAREs), and couples to mitochondrial biogenesis/ATP supply. These pathways jointly tune spike-time precision, sustained firing capacity, and thus stabilizability of large-scale oscillatory field modes.",
      "em_fields": "Mesoscopic EM fields implement low-dimensional control variables (traveling waves, standing connectome harmonics, bounded field pockets) that align spike timing, route working-memory content, and stabilize representations across drift. Subcortical field dynamics (SC, pulvinar, thalamus) carry abstract, context-dependent codes that bias cortical mode selection. Under anesthesia, slow-delta waves crowd out structured alpha/beta/gamma organization; deep thalamic stimulation can restore the requisite field coordination.",
      "microtubules": "Direct microtubule-based EM generation remains speculative for consciousness per se, but microtubule lattice stability under TAU isoform and PTM control demonstrably shapes axonal transport, AIS organization, spine integrity, receptor signaling, and mitochondrial support—indirectly governing temporal precision and the capacity to sustain coherent field modes.",
      "signaling_pathways": "Diffuse neuromodulators set global gain/band preferences. TAU-linked pathways (Fyn–NMDA, GSK3β phosphorylation, PP2A dephosphorylation, TTLL6–spastin polyglutamylation) dynamically tune MT stability, receptor signaling, and localization. Interoceptive baroreceptor signaling triggers theta-synchronized cortical networks. Tecto-pulvinar–thalamo-cortical and tecto–basal ganglia loops convey SC-derived priority and abstract category signals to shape pulvinar gating and cortical recruitment.",
      "perturbation_effects": "Thalamic stimulation reverses anesthetic unconsciousness by reinstating band-specific coherence and traveling-wave organization. tFUS and TI steer frequency-specific field patterns in deep and cortical hubs to causally modulate mood, memory, and connectivity with lasting aftereffects. Kinase/phosphatase interventions (GSK3β inhibition, PP2A activation) and tau isoform/PTM modulation are predicted to sharpen spike-time precision, restore alpha/beta traveling-wave stability, and improve conscious access in tauopathy contexts."
    },
    "integration_framework": "State-setting subcortical hubs (thalamus, SC, brainstem) establish arousal, orienting priority, and an egocentric pivot. Interoceptive rhythms inject periodic theta-phase references. On this scaffold, cortex selects and stabilizes connectome-constrained field modes (traveling waves and harmonics) that form bounded pockets aligning spike timing and routing content via beta–gamma gating. Cytoskeletal infrastructure—especially TAU isoform- and PTM-governed microtubule dynamics, AIS organization, actin–MT cross-talk, presynaptic cycling, and mitochondrial support—sets the precision and endurance of these modes, determining which field configurations can be selected and maintained. Prefrontal reality monitoring closes the integration window, broadcasting and writing stabilized content into long-term memory via countercurrent cortical–hippocampal loops; neuromodulators and disease-state cytoskeletal alterations shift field-mode accessibility and stability.",
    "key_predictions": [
      "In MCI/early AD, resting alpha/beta traveling-wave organization and connectome-harmonic stability will inversely track CSF phosphorylated-tau (pTau) and tau PTM burden; stronger deviations will predict poorer perceptual confidence and working-memory access.",
      "Acute GSK3β inhibition or PP2A activation in tauopathy models will increase alpha/beta standing-wave stability, improve WM readout and perceptual thresholds, and reduce excessive NMDA-driven excitability; effects will exceed changes in band power alone.",
      "Manipulating dendritic TTLL6 or spastin will degrade prefrontal beta traveling-wave coherence and WM performance, with rescue by restoring MT stability.",
      "AIS integrity metrics (length, ankyrin-G density) will correlate with spike-time precision, beta traveling-wave consistency, and conscious report thresholds across individuals and disease states.",
      "Isoform-selective tau modulation (reducing pathogenic 1N4R/2N4R interactions with Fyn or presynaptic proteins) will sharpen timing alignment and increase cross-area beta/theta coherence without necessarily increasing mean firing or BOLD.",
      "Presynaptic vesicle-cycle challenges (e.g., dynamin inhibition) will selectively impair sustained high-frequency synchrony and reduce field-pocket stability, degrading conscious access during prolonged tasks.",
