    "description": "Conscious access corresponds to the stabilization and reconfiguration of spatially organized cortical electromagnetic field patterns over ~50–300 ms windows, orchestrated by attention that modulates slow-phase alignment and oscillatory/aperiodic dynamics. Interoceptive versus exteroceptive focus differentially configures these field topographies and their information-theoretic structure, enabling decoding of conscious content without peripheral physiological changes.",
