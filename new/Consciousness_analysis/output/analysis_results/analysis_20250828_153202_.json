    "description": "Conscious processing may be supported by distributed subcortical-cortical loops in which the superior colliculus rapidly encodes and routes abstract, task-relevant information while maintaining orthogonality to motor plans to avoid interference. This suggests conscious access is not exclusively neocortical and can leverage evolutionarily conserved midbrain hubs for fast categorization and decision signals.",

    {
      "finding": "Superior colliculus (SC) robustly and rapidly encodes abstract visual categories, sometimes more strongly and earlier than posterior parietal cortex (LIP).",
      "quotes": [
        "“The SC exhibits robust encoding of learned visual categories, which is stronger than in the PPC and arises at a similar latency in the two areas.”",
        "“In SC, category classifier accuracy rapidly increased within ~170 ms of sample onset and remained at almost 100% throughout the rest of the trial.”",
        "“Among these early-onset tuned neurons, SC had lower median latency than LIP (LIP: 330 ± 105 ms, SC: 270 ± 90; P = .016, two-tailed permutation test).”"
      ],
      "relevance": "Identifies a fast, subcortical locus for higher-order cognitive coding, suggesting that substrates relevant to conscious access may include midbrain hubs, not solely neocortex."
    },
    {
      "finding": "SC category signals are not explained by microsaccades or eye position patterns during the task.",
      "quotes": [
        "“These results indicate that SC category selectivity cannot be accounted for by category-specific eye movements during the DMC task, and raise the possibility that the eye movements may instead be a consequence of the presence of category selectivity in the SC.”"
      ],
      "relevance": "Supports the interpretation that SC activity reflects cognitive content rather than confounding motor artifacts, strengthening its relevance to internal (potentially conscious) processing."

    {
      "finding": "Task context is essential: category encoding largely disappears during passive viewing.",
      "quotes": [
        "“Neuronal category encoding in both SC and LIP was largely absent during passive viewing trials (Supplementary Fig. 9), indicating that category selectivity is highly task-dependent…”"
      ],
      "relevance": "Task dependence aligns with the idea that conscious access and report-related processing require engagement of specific control states rather than passive sensory drive."

      "finding": "SC encodes category in visually responsive neurons at shorter latencies than in other SC subpopulations.",
      "quotes": [
        "“Category selectivity emerged earlier in Vis neurons than in Vis-other neurons (Vis: 155 ms, Vis-other: 205 ms, P = .021, permutation test) and Non-vis neurons (Non-vis: 634 ms, P < .001, two-tailed permutation test).”"
      ],
      "relevance": "Indicates that incoming sensory representations are rapidly transformed into abstract codes within SC, supporting a role in early content formation."

    {
      "finding": "Population geometry in SC segregates category and saccade signals into near-orthogonal subspaces, minimizing motor interference.",
      "quotes": [
        "“In both monkeys, alignment between the category and saccade subspaces was near-orthogonal… and the resulting alignment index was closer to 0 than expected by chance (Fig. 3e; Monkey N: AI = .131…; Monkey S: AI = .205…).”"

      "relevance": "Demonstrates a coding strategy for multiplexing cognitive content with motor plans, relevant to how conscious contents can co-exist with potential action plans without obligatory execution."

      "quotes": [
        "“Both monkeys showed a marked impairment in DMC task performance after muscimol injection (Fig. 4d,e), with a reduction in DMC accuracy on every muscimol infusion session, and no change on saline sessions (Table S3).”"
