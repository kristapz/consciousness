          "quote": "We have reviewed long-lasting postdiction effects in the 350-400ms range. These effects suggest that conscious perception does not generally occur before 350ms after stimulus onset. If conscious perception occurred before that, manipulating post-stimulus processing would be too late to change it. The fact that the fate of a percept can still be changed in that time frame indicates that it was not already conscious. This means that consciousness is slow. It is preceded by a window of unconscious sensory integration that can last up to 450ms in the most extreme cases (Herzog et al. 2020).",
          "interpretation": "This passage argues that conscious perception is preceded by a temporally extended window of unconscious integration, supporting the view that temporal coordination mechanisms gate entry to awareness on ~350–450 ms scales (relevant to timing and segmentation in both brains and AI systems) ."
