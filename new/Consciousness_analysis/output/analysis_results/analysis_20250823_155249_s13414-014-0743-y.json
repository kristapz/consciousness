    "description": "Conscious access follows an initial, nonselective fast pass in which both to-be-figure and to-be-ground regions can reach high-level (semantic) representations, with awareness emerging only after competitive, recurrent resolution of figure–ground organization. Shape features of losing contenders are suppressed, but their semantics can transiently influence behavior outside awareness.",
