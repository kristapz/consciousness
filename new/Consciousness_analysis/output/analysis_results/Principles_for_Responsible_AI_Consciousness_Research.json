These include: controlling the breadth of deployment and the ways in which systems are used; assessing the capabilities and potential for consciousness of systems at several stages of development and deployment; increasing capabilities gradually and only introducing those that are needed for the system’s intended purpose (as far as this is possible, given the difficulties of predicting the capabilities of some systems in advance); and controlling access to information that would enable irresponsible actors to build systems that may be conscious.",
