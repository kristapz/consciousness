    "description": "Conscious access corresponds to the transient selection and stabilization of connectome-specific harmonic modes shaped by structural connectivity and the current excitation–inhibition balance. These large-scale, frequency-specific standing waves align distributed regions over ~100 ms windows, and their stability tracks transitions into and out of consciousness.",

Such coordinated population activity is the physical source of measurable extracellular EM fields (EEG/MEG/LFP), so these findings indirectly support the emergence of spatially organized EM fields from coordinated neural dynamics.",

      ],
      "interpretation": "Both prior empirical work and the authors’ neural-field-on-connectome model indicate that unconsciousness involves reduced coupling among key hubs (e.g., DMN midline) and a shift toward slower, more global oscillations, consistent with destabilization/reconfiguration of the large-scale field-like patterns that support conscious access. This provides indirect support for the idea that stability of macroscopic patterns (and by extension their EM correlates) is degraded during anesthesia-induced unconsciousness.",
      "strength": "moderate",
      "limitations": "No direct anesthesia experiments were performed in this study; EM field 'pockets' and spiking activity were not measured. Evidence is partly inferential from modeling plus literature citations rather than direct recording of EM field stability under anesthesia."
