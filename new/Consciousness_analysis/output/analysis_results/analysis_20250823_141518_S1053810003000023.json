    "description": "Consciousness functions as a subcortical ‘reality space’ that stabilizes multimodal spatial information and motivational biasing to guide action, implemented by an upper-brainstem core (superior colliculus, hypothalamus/PAG, zona incerta, mesopontine state nuclei) and supplemented by cortex. Neuromodulatory systems gate global state and thereby tune the dynamics through which this reality space supports access and control.",

      "interpretation": "The paper identifies serotonergic (raphé), adrenergic (locus coeruleus), and cholinergic (pedunculopontine/laterodorsal) nuclei—as well as dopaminergic ventral tegmental area within the same core—as global state controllers that gate wakefulness, vigilance, and activity. This supports the idea that neuromodulators regulate the gain and temporal regime under which oscillatory dynamics relevant to conscious access operate, even though the paper does not explicitly quantify frequency-band tuning.",
      "strength": "moderate",
      "limitations": "No direct measurements of oscillatory gain or preferred frequency bands are presented; the link to frequency-specific modulation is inferential from state control by neuromodulators rather than demonstrated with spectral analyses."
