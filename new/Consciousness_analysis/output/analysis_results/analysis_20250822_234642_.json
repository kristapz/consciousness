    "description": "Conscious sensory phenomenology is proposed to be a subcortically implemented global best estimate assembled in dorsal pulvinar, tethered to a non-phenomenal egocentric pivot generated by superior colliculus priority-gating of orienting/attention. The first-person perspective arises from the geometry and control needs of gaze/attention, with SC providing directional pointers that shape pulvinar-based phenomenal content for action control.",

        "I have previously proposed that this running best estimate is extracted from cortical probabilistic preliminaries by a subcortical neural “reality model” implementing our conscious sensory phenomenology.",
        "At the interface between cortex and colliculus lies the dorsal pulvinar. Its unique long-range inhibitory circuitry may precipitate the brain’s global best estimate of its momentary circumstances through multiple constraint satisfaction across its afferents from numerous cortical areas and colliculus.",
        "The dorsal pulvinar of the higher-order thalamus is a multimodal region connected with high level posterior parietal and temporal areas of both streams of the visual system, with auditory association cortex and multimodal cortical areas, as well as with parahippocampal, prefrontal (including frontal eye fields), orbitofrontal, and insular cortices.",
        "The caudal reaches of this dorsal pulvinar territory are invested with a unique population of long range inhibitory interneurons... These axons, being inhibitory, can hardly avoid establishing competitive linkages and bridges across these interdigitated slabs."

        "Apparently the superior colliculus occupies a central position in the descending connectivity of the cortical gaze fields, suggestive of “superhub” status in informal graph theoretic terms.",
        "The superior colliculus provides a comprehensive mutual interface for brain systems carrying information relevant to defining the location of high priority targets for immediate re-orienting of receptor surfaces, there to settle their several bids for such a priority location by mutual competition and synergy, resulting in a single momentarily prevailing priority location subject to immediate implementation by deflecting behavioral or attentional orientation to that location.",
        "Selection of the spatial target for the next orienting movement is not a matter of sensory locations alone, but requires access to situational, motivational, state, and context information determining behavioral priorities. It combines, in other words, bottom-up “salience” with top-down “relevance.”"

        "It is conceivable, therefore, that somewhere beneath the cortex there is a target or set of targets of these cortical layer V pyramidal cell axons in which their “reporting” on the cortical pattern of conjoint activation of feedforward and feedback activity becomes conscious, after passing a threshold in that subcortical terminus."
