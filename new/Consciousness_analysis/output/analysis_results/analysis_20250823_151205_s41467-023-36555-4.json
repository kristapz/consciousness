    "description": "Selective access to and routing of working-memory content is implemented by low-dimensional, spatially structured beta–gamma field dynamics that gate and align high-dimensional, item-specific spiking. These oscillatory field patterns provide a network-level control surface that coordinates timing across distributed populations independent of fine-grained recurrent connectivity.",
