    "description": "Conscious access depends on network-level integration that can be causally modulated by targeted tFUS of cortical and subcortical hubs, producing immediate and lasting changes in connectivity and reportability. Ultrasound likely acts via mechanosensitive and voltage-gated ion channel interactions, enabling parameter-specific entrainment and plastic aftereffects that tune the brain’s oscillatory landscape for access.",
