    "description": "Conscious access under direct cortical stimulation depends on a locally escalating excitability process—driven by initial inhibition followed by intratrain facilitation and glia-mediated K+ accumulation—until sustained neuronal activity is reached. Stabilized population activity is reflected in macroscopic field potentials, and repetitive stimulation induces aftereffects that transiently bias network excitability beyond the stimulation window.",

After such stimulation, the number of responses per visual stimulus could double... Thus, the excitability of the cortex increases both to electrical stimulation and to natural visual stimuli during and immediately after direct cortical stimulation.",
