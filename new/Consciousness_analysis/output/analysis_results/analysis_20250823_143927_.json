    "description": "Conscious access arises from recurrent, lamina-specific interactions between feedforward and feedback ‘countercurrent’ streams across cortex, which also gate what is written into long-term, contextually embedded “personal history.” A hippocampal apex acts as a temporary buffer enabling retrospective integration when immediate contextual matches are unavailable.",

          "quote": "The basic assumption of the present proposal is that the accretion of personal history is directly dependent upon interaction between feedforward and feedback pathways, in two functionally linked ways: first, interaction between the two currents establishes the neural conditions for conscious awareness (Lamme and Roelfsema, 2000; Lamme and Spekreijse, 2000) as the sole functional “gate” through which information enters personal history.",

          "quote": "The functional efficacy of the front-to-back current of cortical information flow (Teuber, 1978, p. 900) is reflected in phenomena such as the use of primary visual cortex by working memory for the temporary retention of visual detail (Supèr et al., 2001). Even low-level perceptual learning appears to recruit countercurrent involvement with increasing task difficulty (Ahissar and Hochstein, 1997).",

      "interpretation": "The paper argues that conscious access requires recurrent (feedback–feedforward) interactions, citing Lamme’s work that differentiates an early feedforward sweep from later recurrent processing. This directly aligns with backward masking findings where initial visual responses are preserved while later recurrent coherence is disrupted, preventing conscious access.",
      "strength": "moderate",
      "limitations": "The paper is theoretical and does not present masking data; backward masking is not named explicitly here, and support relies on cited literature (e.g., Lamme & Roelfsema) for the empirical dissociation of early vs. late processing."
