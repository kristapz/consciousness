  "theory_synthesis": "Conscious access arises when a prefrontal ‘discriminator’ monitors the reliability of sensory signals and outputs a higher-order pointer to trustworthy first-order representations, thereby creating a stubborn disposition to believe. Phenomenal character can be paired with this access account via quality space theory, which ties how experiences feel to the system’s discriminability structure.",

      "finding": "A prefrontal ‘discriminator’ monitors sensory reliability and outputs higher-order pointer representations that gate conscious access.",

        "“PRM aims to provide a mechanistic account of consciousness… The basic idea of PRM is that consciousness involves monitoring the reliability of one’s own sensory signals.”",
        "“We need a gateway between perception and cognition—a mechanism for distinguishing between cases where neuronal activity reliably indicates the presence of the signaled features from cases in which it doesn’t. PRM hypothesizes the existence of a mechanism for doing just that: the perceptual reality monitor, or ‘discriminator’.”",
        "“The output of the discriminator is a mental representation containing a symbol akin to what computer scientists call a ‘pointer’.”",
        "“PRM holds that one consciously represents a feature when the discriminator monitors the relevant representational state and outputs a pointer to that state to the belief system.”"

        "“There is evidence for the view that a network of areas in the prefrontal cortex (PFC)… could implement a perceptual reality monitoring mechanism.”",
        "“Tanigawa et al. (2022) obtained a similar result: while the visual cortex has similar representations for perceived versus memorized contents, they are associated with different oscillatory patterns in lateral PFC, suggesting that processes in PFC determine whether a representation is consciously perceived or stored in memory.”",

      "quotes": [
        "“participants tend to have a higher rate of false alarms in detection tasks when pre-stimulus neuronal excitability is high. Not only that, but participants also provide higher confidence and visibility ratings… even if their accuracy on the task is identical…”",

      "quotes": [
        "“These images are unlikely caused by external events, since external events don’t usually follow eye movements… As predicted by PRM, when this is done, the stimulus disappears from consciousness (in most cases).”",
        "“In a standard MIB display, a stationary stimulus… disappears from consciousness when presented on a moving background… The discriminator might discard the target signal, despite its salience, because of its similarity to a perceptual scotoma.”"

      "quotes": [
        "“Following the lesion, sensory activity (for both noise and signals) decreases significantly… a discriminator that fails to learn the new, lower noise level will categorize visual signals as unreliable.”",
        "“Subjective inflation refers to… more false alarms and… overly confident… decisions for stimuli in the periphery… explained either by a discriminator that underestimates how noisy the visual periphery really is… or by incorrect assumptions about the shape of the noise distribution…”"
