    "description": "Microtubules act as endogenous ionic oscillators capable of radiating weak electromagnetic power whose frequency content is tuned by lattice stabilization, suggesting a cytoskeletal contribution to frequency-specific neural coherence. Such MT-based oscillatory fields could supplement synaptic coupling by providing an additional substrate for timing alignment and gamma-range entrainment in neural tissue.",

While not a direct measure of spike–field coherence, this demonstrates that lattice stabilization enhances frequency-specific phase alignment at the level of MT oscillators, a prerequisite mechanism that could promote coherence in neural tissue.",

      "limitations": "The experiments are on isolated bovine brain MTs in vitro without neurons; no direct measurement of neural spiking or spike–field coupling. Moreover, in MT sheets Paclitaxel has been reported to inhibit oscillations (context-dependent effect), so stabilization may both restrict frequency and reduce oscillation amplitude under some conditions."
