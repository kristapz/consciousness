    "description": "Conscious perceptual access depends on late, feedback-mediated recruitment of sensory representations by prefrontal circuitry, with enhanced fronto-parietal synchrony supporting reportable awareness. Neuromodulatory control (e.g., cholinergic tone) and frequency-specific entrainment further bias this feedback process and its effectiveness.",

      "interpretation": "Direct manipulation of cholinergic tone in PFC can switch the global conscious state, consistent with neuromodulators controlling network excitability and oscillatory dynamics relevant for access. NMDA-dependent disruption of fronto-parietal feedback further ties receptor-level neuromodulation to large-scale dynamics needed for awareness.",
      "strength": "moderate",
      "limitations": "The paper demonstrates neuromodulatory control of conscious state but does not directly quantify changes in oscillatory gain or preferred frequency bands; evidence is strongest for ACh and NMDA mechanisms, not across all listed neuromodulators."

      "strength": "moderate",
