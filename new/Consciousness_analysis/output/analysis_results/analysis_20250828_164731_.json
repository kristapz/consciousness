Inflammatory milieu further amplifies this trafficking control, implying state-dependent gating of timing-relevant excitability.",

      "interpretation": "By increasing Nav1.7 mRNA, current density, and axonal surface levels, PTX raises Nav channel availability at peripheral terminals, lowering spike threshold and shaping spike initiation. While oscillatory phase-locking was not measured, the established role of Nav1.7 as a threshold channel implies that its density modulates the precision of spike onset, a prerequisite for precise phase relationships in oscillations.",

      "interpretation": "Because PTX stabilizes microtubules, the observed dose-dependent increases (low dose) or decreases (high dose) in Nav1.7 vesicle flux and the increased surface localization at axonal endings show that cytoskeletal stability directly governs ion-channel delivery to functional domains. This trafficking control is a mechanistic route by which microtubules can influence spike initiation timing, and thereby precision, via modulation of the local channel landscape.",

The observed changes in vesicle flux/velocity and surface delivery of Nav1.7 are consistent with PTM-dependent tuning of microtubule lattice properties that affect transport dynamics, a plausible route to influence neuronal timing precision via altered channel distribution.",
