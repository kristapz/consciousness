    "description": "Conscious states can be shaped by training that targets specific EEG frequency bands, suggesting that experience-dependent plasticity tunes large-scale electromagnetic field dynamics associated with attention and emotion regulation. Closed-loop neurofeedback that reinforces desired oscillatory signatures may thus scaffold the formation and maintenance of task-relevant field configurations that support sustained conscious access.",

      "interpretation": "EEG bands (alpha, theta, gamma) are macroscopic readouts of coordinated neuronal currents that generate extracellular electromagnetic fields. Reports of meditation-related band-specific changes and high-amplitude gamma synchrony imply that coordinated neural activity produces measurable, structured field dynamics, consistent with spatially organized EM fields emerging from coordination.",

By analogy, repeated closed-loop modulation (here via feedback rather than direct stimulation) leads to lasting aftereffects in oscillatory regimes associated with attention and mood.",
