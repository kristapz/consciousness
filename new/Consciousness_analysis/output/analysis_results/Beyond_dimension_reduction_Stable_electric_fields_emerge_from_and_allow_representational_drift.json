          "quote": "The extra step that allowed us to obtain the electric field above was the mapping of the latent space to a cortical patch (Pinotsis et al., 2017). Starting from the connectivity components, we obtained the weights that scaled incoming input to each population from all other populations in the ensemble, called the connectivity kernel. This describes information exchange and electrical activity on the patch. Having this, we then reconstructed the EF.",
          "interpretation": "This passage shows how representational structure is encoded: latent variables (connectivity components) are explicitly mapped to spatially organized connectivity kernels that define information exchange on the cortical patch, a key step for understanding how neural populations encode, organize, and access task-relevant content ."

          "quote": "We found that a large part of electrodes had R EF > R NA 2. In other words, electric field estimates were more often correlated across trials, i.e. more stable, compared to neural activity estimates 3. In the next section, we will see that stronger stability of the EF compared to neural activity was also confirmed by decoding analyses. Training accuracy based on neural activity was significantly lower than accuracy based on EF estimates. This also suggests that information contained in delay neural activity was less stable than that contained in the electric field.",
          "interpretation": "These results indicate an emergent, higher-order dynamic at the field level: EFs remain stable and more decodable across trials than underlying neural activity, supporting the idea that stable computations can arise from interactions within a variable substrate (representational drift) ."
