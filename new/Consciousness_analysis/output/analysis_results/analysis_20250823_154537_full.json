    "description": "Targeted low-intensity focused ultrasound to a prefrontal control hub causally alters conscious affect while reconfiguring large-scale functional connectivity, with effects persisting for tens of minutes. This supports a network-control view in which perturbing cortical integration hubs reshapes brain-wide integration states that gate the content and tone of conscious experience.",

While the study did not measure oscillatory coherence per se or target deep structures, it demonstrates that focused tFUS can modulate conscious reportability and brain-wide integration proxies, partially supporting the claim.",

      "interpretation": "Both mood and network connectivity changes persisted 20–30 minutes after brief sonication, indicating aftereffects extending beyond the stimulation window.
