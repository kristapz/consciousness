Energetic limitations thus act as boundary conditions shaping the neural architectures that can realize the constitutive viewpoint required for conscious experience.",

      "interpretation": "The authors emphasize that cortical processing is tightly constrained by energetic costs, citing metabolic expense and the need to optimize under energy constraints. While the paper does not discuss mitochondria, ATP, or specific frequency bands, its argument supports the broader principle that energy availability limits the capacity for fast, sustained neural operations that underpin oscillatory dynamics.",

      "limitations": "No direct measurements or discussion of mitochondrial density, ATP, or oscillation-specific limits; the support is inferential and general (metabolic/energetic constraints) rather than specific to high-frequency oscillations."
