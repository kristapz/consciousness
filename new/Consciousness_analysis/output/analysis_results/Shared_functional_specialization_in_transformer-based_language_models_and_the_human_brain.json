          "quote": "The ith token “attends” to tokens based on the inner product of its query vector Qi with the key vectors for all tokens, K. When the query vector matches a given key, the inner product will be large; the softmax ensures the resulting “attention weights” sum to one. These attention weights are then used to generate a weighted sum of the value vectors, V, which is the final output of the self-attention operation (Eq. 1). We refer to the attention head’s output as the “transformation” produced by that head. Each attention head produces a separate transformation for each input token.",
