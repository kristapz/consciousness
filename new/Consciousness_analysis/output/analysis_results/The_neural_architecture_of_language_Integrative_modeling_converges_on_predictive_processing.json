Fourth, intriguingly, the scores of models initialized with random weights (prior to training, but with a trained linear readout) are well above chance and correlate with trained model scores, which suggests that network architecture is an important contributor to a model’s brain score. In particular, one architecture introduced just in 2019, the generative pretrained transformer (GPT-2), consistently outperforms all other models and explains almost all variance in both fMRI and ECoG data from sentence-processing tasks.",

Indeed, if a model achieves a high brain score on one dataset it tends to also do well on other datasets (Fig. 2D), ruling out the possibility that we are picking up on spurious, dataset-idiosyncratic predictivity and suggesting that the models’ internal representations are general enough to capture brain responses to diverse linguistic materials presented visually or auditorily, and across three independent sets of participants.",
