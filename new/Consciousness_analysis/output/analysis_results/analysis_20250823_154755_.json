  "theory_synthesis": {
    "description": "Brief, spatially targeted ultrasound perturbations can transiently shift cortical excitability beyond the stimulation window, plausibly biasing local network dynamics and creating short-lived windows for altered integration. Conscious access could depend on such temporally bounded gain changes that modulate synchrony without requiring continuous drive.",

        {
          "quote": "Verum tUS increased excitability in the motor cortex (from baseline) by 33.7% immediately following tUS (p = 0.009), and 32.4% (p = 0.047) 6 min later, with excitability no longer significantly different from baseline by 11 min post-stimulation.",

        {
          "quote": "The 2 min duration of tUS used here produces neurophysiological effects that are limited in time, in this case approximately 4 times the duration of stimulation.",
          "page_or_section": "Discussion"
        }
      ],
      "interpretation": "A 2-minute ultrasound bout produced measurable increases in corticospinal excitability that persisted for minutes after stimulation ceased, demonstrating a post-stimulation aftereffect consistent with short-term plasticity. While the study did not measure oscillatory synchrony directly, the sustained shift in baseline excitability beyond the stimulation window aligns with the claim that repetitive/pulsed stimulation induces plastic aftereffects that can modulate network dynamics over subsequent integration periods.",
      "strength": "moderate",
      "limitations": "The study assessed excitability (MEP amplitude), not oscillatory synchrony or conscious access; aftereffects were short-lived (~6â€“10 min) and localized to M1; protocol was not designed to test frequency-specific or closed-loop entrainment."

      "finding": "Stimulation timing relative to other interventions (simultaneous vs. serial) can flip effect polarity.",
      "quotes": [
        "The differences in findings might also be due to contrasting methodologies between the present study and others, where applying tUS simultaneously with TMS leads to inhibitory (100), or null effects (67), whereas serial application as used here leads to excitatory effects."
      ],
      "relevance": "Supports the broader idea that temporal alignment of stimulation with ongoing or concurrent activity critically shapes outcomes, relevant to claims about in-phase vs. out-of-phase stimulation, even though endogenous oscillatory phase was not directly targeted here."

    {
      "finding": "The spatial extent (volume) of stimulated tissue may be more important than frequency or total energy for determining response polarity.",
      "quotes": [
        "The greater brain volume affected by unfocused stimulation, as compared to focused stimulation, might thus be conceptually similar to the increased brain volume that is affected by lowering the frequency of focused ultrasound.",
        "In both cases, the sheer volume of brain tissue involved might be more important than the total energy delivered."
      ],
      "relevance": "Highlights a spatial-integration principle that could influence formation of large-scale coherent activity patterns, informing how ultrasound parameters might be tuned to affect network-level dynamics implicated in conscious access."
