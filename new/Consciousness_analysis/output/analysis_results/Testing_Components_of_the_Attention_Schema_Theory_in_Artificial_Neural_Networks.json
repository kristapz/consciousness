          "quote": "Experiment 1 showed that the presence of an attention schema in a network (the trained ability to predict its own attention states) confers two specific advantages, at least in one kind of network with a specific implementation of attention and of an attention schema. The first advantage is that when a network with an attention schema is pretrained on a task, that network is then better able to learn to make judgements about the attention states of other networks. The second advantage is that when a network contains an attention schema, its attention states become easier for other networks to interpret and categorize.",
