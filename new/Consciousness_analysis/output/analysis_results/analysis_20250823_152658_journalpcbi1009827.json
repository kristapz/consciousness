    "description": "Conscious access may rely on spatially structured extracellular field dynamics—manifesting as traveling waves—that coordinate spike timing across prefrontal circuits. Such mesoscopic phase-gradient patterns can be directionally modulated by task demands, supporting temporal integration needed for working memory and, by extension, unified conscious episodes.",

      "interpretation": "Local field potentials (extracellular electromagnetic signals arising from coordinated synaptic currents) exhibited consistent phase gradients and directionality across microelectrode arrays, demonstrating spatially organized EM field patterns (traveling waves). The presence of organized phase maps, preferred propagation axes, and characteristic speeds indicates emergent mesoscopic EM structure from coordinated neuronal activity.",

      "limitations": "Evidence is mesoscopic and localized (3×3 mm arrays) without direct demonstration of large-scale or cross-areal field organization or causal EM influence; analyses are correlational and focus on 4–30 Hz bands."
