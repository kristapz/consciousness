This reduced MT-MT spacing, together with the increase in MT bundle domain size, precisely when increasing amounts of rings and smaller curved tubulin oligomers begin proliferating, suggests that tubulin oligomers directly affect the bundling of MTs and drive the Bws to Bint transition observed through SAXS and TEM.",
