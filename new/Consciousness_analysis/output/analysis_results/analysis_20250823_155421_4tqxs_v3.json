    "description": "Conscious visual experience reflects a metacognitive reality-monitoring process that fixes a coherent world model over relatively slow (~300–500 ms) integration windows to support model-based planning, while rapid online action is guided by unconscious feedforward and dorsal-stream processes. The timing and presence of late recurrent/broadcast processes, not early feedforward responses, determine conscious access.",

        {
          "quote": "In metacontrast masking, presenting a mask 70ms after a target—a 70ms stimulus-onset asynchrony (SOA)—can make the target invisible.",

        },
        {
          "quote": "information takes about 50ms to travel from the retina to the first stage of visual cortical processing in the primary visual cortex... the first feed-forward sweep of visual cortical processing is generally believed to occur unconsciously, and complex feedback processing does not seem to shape perception before around 120ms.",

        {
          "quote": "We have reviewed long-lasting postdiction effects in the 350-400ms range. These effects suggest that conscious perception does not generally occur before 350ms after stimulus onset.",
          "page_or_section": "Postdiction and the speed of consciousness"
        }
      ],
      "interpretation": "The paper shows that in backward/metacontrast masking, a mask arriving after the target can abolish conscious report, implying target-related early feedforward processing occurred but did not suffice for awareness. The authors emphasize that conscious perception requires later recurrent/broadcast processes (>~120 ms, often ~300–400 ms), consistent with the idea that when access fails in masking, early responses are preserved while later integrative processes (the putative substrate of late coherence) are disrupted.",
      "strength": "moderate",
      "limitations": "The paper does not present direct electrophysiological evidence of preserved early responses alongside reduced late coherence within masking trials; rather, it synthesizes prior literature to argue that early feedforward activity is unconscious and later processes determine conscious access. No explicit measures of ‘coherence’ are reported."
