    "description": "Conscious experience depends on biologically grounded, dynamical processes in which metabolism-generated electromagnetic fields and diffuse neuromodulatory signaling modulate large-scale neural coordination under energetic (metabolic) constraints. On this view, structured EM activity emerging from coordinated neural dynamics participates in binding and access, but only within a living, autopoietic substrate.",

      "interpretation": "The paper explicitly treats electromagnetic fields as candidate, functionally relevant neural processes and notes that macroscopic EEG fields are detectable, implying emergence from coordinated neural activity. Reference to neural synchronisation (e.g., gamma) further situates EM field generation within coordinated population dynamics that produce measurable field structure.",

      "strength": "weak",
      "limitations": "No direct evidence is given that spiking remains intact when fields are disrupted, nor that specific field ‘stability’ or ‘pocket’ structure is the key variable; the account is presented as a proposal rather than demonstrated finding."

      "interpretation": "The paper repeatedly ties neural activity to metabolic constraints and thermodynamic costs, implying energetic ceilings on neural dynamics.
