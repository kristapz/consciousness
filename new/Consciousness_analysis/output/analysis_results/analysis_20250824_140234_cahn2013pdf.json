    "description": "Meditation modulates spatially structured corticothalamic EM field dynamics and frequency-specific oscillatory mechanisms, enhancing early stimulus representation (gamma/theta/alpha) while reducing frontal delta reactivity, thereby biasing conscious awareness toward clearer, less reactive percepts. Conscious access is thus shaped by state-dependent organization of field patterns and band-specific synchrony over 20–900 ms integration windows.",
