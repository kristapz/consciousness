    "description": "Endogenous electrical oscillations generated by neuronal microtubule bundles can form dynamic intracellular electric fields with cross-frequency structure, potentially scaffolding timing alignment within and across neurons beyond synaptic mechanisms. Such cytoskeletal field dynamics could modulate which neural assemblies temporally cohere, contributing to the integration steps necessary for conscious access.",

While measured at the intracellular/cytoskeletal level rather than as macroscopic extracellular fields, this provides mechanistic support that coordinated cellular activity (here, MT oscillators) can give rise to structured EM fields, a prerequisite for larger-scale field organization.",
