    "description": "Conscious state depends on neuromodulatory control (notably serotonergic 5-HT2A signaling) of large-scale oscillatory regimes, which shifts alpha/theta–gamma coupling and network synchrony, thereby regulating the brain’s entropy and accessible repertoire of states. Under 5-HT2A-driven perturbations, alpha power in DMN hubs collapses and cross-frequency interactions reorganize, pushing the system toward higher-entropy, more metastable dynamics that alter self-related content and access.",
