    "description": "Conscious access depends on the organization of mesoscopic electromagnetic field dynamics: structured, directionally distributed fast-band traveling waves support cognition, while anesthesia imposes dominant slow-delta waves that reorient and destabilize higher-frequency field patterns. Thus, unified access arises when large-scale EM field configurations permit long-range timing alignment rather than being crowded out by slow-delta dominance.",
