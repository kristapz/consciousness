          "quote": "One example of miscommunication is when mechanism language is used to refer to neural correlates of interest, such as the neural correlates of consciousness, and it is not clear whether mechanism is intended in a causal sense or in a non-causal, ‘mere’ correlation sense (which is suggested by the term ‘correlate’)112–115. This usage has engendered confusion about whether a mere correlate or cause of consciousness is being referred to, which is supported by slippage between a causal and a non-causal use of mechanism116,117.",
